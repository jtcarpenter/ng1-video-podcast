Although it is slightly over-engineered for such a simple app,
the app is broken down into seperate modules to demonstrate how
I might structure a slightly more complex app

## App structure


## Run the node server

$ npm start

## Vagrant

$ IP="192.168.33.99" vagrant up

## How to run tests

$ sudo npm install -g karma-cli

Install Phantom
